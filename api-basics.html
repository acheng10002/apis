<!-- API Basics
- API - set of rules and protocols that allows apps to communicate with 
each other
- Jamstack architecture technique - host backend and database on a server
(Heroku or Digital Ocean) and use a service (hosted platform or cloud 
provider) to host the front end 
- Jamstack allows me to use a single backend source for multiple frontend
apps, such as a website, a desktop app, or a mobile app 
- frontend and backend apps usually talk to each other using JSON 
- I now need to get my Express app to speak JSON instead of HTML 
-- I mainly need to pass my information into res.json() instead of res.send
or res.render() 
- APIs can take many forms: /api/getAllPostComments/:postid or /api/posts/:postid/comments
- Know what REST stands for
-- REST - Representational State Transfer, organization method for my APIs
which correspond with CRUD actions 
-- elements of REST - statelessness, cacheability i.e. use Express to output JSON
-- how should I organize my endpoint URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers)
-- REST APIs are resource based
--- so instead of having names like /getPostComments or /savePostInDatabase 
--- use HTTP verbs such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE
- Explain the purpose of using REST when structuring an API
-- makes my API more maintainable and makes it easier for other devs to 
integrate with my API
- Detail the REST naming conventions for my API endpoints 
-- API name usually takes the form of 2 URI's per resource, one for the whole
collection and one for a single object in that collection
--- /posts - one URI for the whole collection of blog posts
--- /posts/:postid - second URI for a single object in that collection
--- (collections can be nested in this way)
--- /posts/:postid/comments - gets the list of comments on a single post
--- /posts/:postid/comments/:commentid - gets a single comment
- Have a reinforced understanding of the HTTP Methods/Verbs
-- Why are HTTP verbs important to an API
--- HTTP verbs determine the action
-- Which HTTP verb does each letter in CRUD correspond to 
--- POST verb, Create action, ex. POST /posts Creates a new blog post
--- GET verb, Read action, ex. 	GET /posts/:postid Fetches a single post
--- PUT verb, Update action, ex. PUT /posts/:postid Updates a single post
--- DELETE verb, Delete action, ex. DELETE /posts/:postid Deletes a single post
--- each part of an API URI specifies the resource
- Describe the Same Origin Policy
-- security measure that says "only requests from the same origin (same IP
address or URL) should be allowed to access this API"
- Explain the purpose of CORS
-- CORS - cross-origin resource sharing enables my API to be accessed from 
different origins
-- Setting up CORS in Express, a middleware does the work for me
-- a production environmentm, I will want to specifically block access from 
any origin except my frontend website
- Use CORS as middleware in Express (globally and on a single route) 
- Configure CORS to only allow certain origins to access my API
- Explain CORS headers -->
